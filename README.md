# ChatBot_using_NLP
This is a ChatBot I made for a HACKATHON in my firm. It uses NLP to select a response from a library of predefined responses(i.e. Dataset).

run using

-> python3 chatbot.py

ask what you want to ask the bot.

You can add your own conversations to the dataset so that the bot can reply back accordingly.
